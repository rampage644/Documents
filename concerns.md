# Team concerns

+ Unit testing, functional testing each component, integrational testing!
+ Planning (milestones, deadlines), task list
+ Team talking (problems discussion?)
+ Reports? (subsitute with testing?)
+ Where are we moving? Update team more frequently about what's going on


# Personal concern: what to do? OR where to go?

I'm OK with answering former question but i need to know **where we want to go?**, vector if you want.

I'd like to have some not-too-much-lasting dev projects alongside with some organizational/managerial work. If i understand correctly what you want me to be in our team.

Possible tasks:

+ Visual debugging (patch either Eclipse or Nemiver)
+ Automate UI testing
+ Integrational testing (UI+zwift+python)
+ Temporary UI developing (i really hate js)

Will be glad to start some dev project (2-3 months).

Reading through team sources is wasteful without task. Really. No interest, no motivation. Depression starts.
At the moment i've already read through liteauth sources (not zerocloud or swift itself), current UI, zrt, sphinx indexer and searcher, zerovm-2.0.

It's just a waste of time if you just need to be aware 'what is going on?'. I'll never get as much deep into source codebase as prime contributer in all codebases. Think it's much better to maintain **constantly updating** task list for each project with frequent (weekly basis) talks.
