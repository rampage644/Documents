# Thoughts

First, i'd like to exclude first step of building native python and pgen executables. Unfortunately, i can't locate pgen at host by default. Need to workaround it somehow: provide built-in pgen (written in python, for instance).

Next, add patch to configure script directly into repository.

Modify README/INSTALL.

Have a look (here)[http://wiki.osdev.org/Porting_Python]
