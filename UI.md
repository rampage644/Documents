# UI

## Past

### Screenshots:

+ HK Summit version
+ Marianna design version

### What have been done?

+ Features added since HK
+ Features added since Jan 2014
+ Features removed since HK

**What was the problem with Alex code?** Why do we need to reject it? Alex had done a lot. How long will it take to restore all functionality?

Backlog of all large features and their status. Proof links.

## Future

+ List of task required by next release
+ Features to be added
+ Features to be removed
+ Differences with current production UI (**what is in production?**)
+ Non-UI work

### Help needed?
